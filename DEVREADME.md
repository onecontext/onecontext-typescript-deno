# Official OneContext TypeScript SDK

## Want to help develop this?

Great!

Here's some helpful info:

### Run the checks (checks type-safety, nothing more) 

```zsh
deno check .
```

### Run the tests 

-A gives the test runner access to read/write to the file-system.

```zsh
deno test -A
```

### Publish a new version 

Publishing a new version is handled automagically when you push with a new version number in deno.json (GitHub action).

Only OneContext members can push / merge to main.
